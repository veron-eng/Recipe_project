# Recipe_project
started on week 8 of Bnta bootcamp, part of the html wire frame lab 


## Envisioning your project 

i want to create a recipe website page 

with a header that has a logo in the middle and header stuff on either side of it 

then in the main section have picture of some food and then some text just above it, i will have this in the same div so in css i can adjust it so the text lies ontop of it.


and then have 6 of the top recipes ill have 3 on a row.


and then i will have an about section about the bussiness with a picture on the left and then some lorem ipsum on the right 

and then the footer will just have similar stuff as the header
